# Introduction
flashflood is a ringbuffer on steroids for golang

The buffer is a traditional ring buffer but has features to receive the flushed out elements on a channel.
You can set the gate amount in order to group elements flushed out and/or perform transformations on them using FuncStack callbacks

# Getting Started

## Simple Usage using a channel

>
    	ff := flashflood.New(&flashflood.Opts{})
        ch, err := ff.GetChan()

        select {
        case v := <-ch:
            fmt.Printf("FLUSHED: %#v\n", v)
        }

# Contributing 
You can help to deliver a better flashflood buffer, check out things you can do [CoC.md](CoC.md)
